# 🚀 Notepad Modernizer: Legacy to Layout

Notepad Modernizer is a single-file coding simulation educational game designed to guide beginners and legacy-era developers in transitioning from old-school design mindsets (like using <table> and <center>) to Modern Web Design standards.

Learning web development has never been this fun! With a retro, hacker-vibes terminal aesthetic, you will be guided to build a modern Landing Page step-by-step.
